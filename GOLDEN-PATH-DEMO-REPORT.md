- **Firewall**: Permissive rules for development (ports 22, 80, 8080, 3000, 9090, 8008)

## 🔧 Phase 3: System Architecture Validation ✅

### Golden Path Features Demonstrated
1. **Modular Configuration**: Clean separation of concerns
   - Foundation modules (base, networking, nix-config)
   - Service modules (GitLab with all dependencies)
   - Security modules (certificates, minimal in development)

2. **Environment-Specific Builds**: 
   - Development: HTTP-only, permissive security
   - Production: HTTPS, full hardening  
   - Demo: Minimal services

3. **Comprehensive Service Stack**:
   - GitLab CE with Docker runner support
   - PostgreSQL with optimized settings
   - Redis with memory management
   - Nginx reverse proxy
   - Docker with KVM support
   - LibVirtD for VM support

4. **Resource Management**:
   - GitLab: 8GB memory limit, 50% CPU quota
   - GitLab Runner: 4GB memory limit, 25% CPU quota
   - PostgreSQL: Optimized connection pooling
   - Redis: 512MB memory limit with LRU eviction

## 🏗️ Advanced Features Demonstrated

### GitLab Enterprise Features
- **Container Registry**: Running on port 5000
- **Large File Support**: 10GB max request size
- **LFS Storage**: Enabled with dedicated storage path  
- **Artifacts**: 10GB artifact storage limit
- **CI/CD Runner**: Docker + KVM support for nested VMs

### Security Architecture (Development Mode)
- **Development Overrides**: Password-less sudo, SSH password auth
- **Certificate Management**: Self-signed certificates for development
- **Network Security**: Trusted interfaces, controlled port access
- **Service Isolation**: Dedicated users and groups

### DevOps Best Practices
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Everything defined in Nix
- **Reproducible Builds**: Exact same environment every time  
- **Version Controlled**: All configuration in Git
- **Modular Design**: Composable modules for different environments
- **Resource Limits**: Proper systemd resource management

## 📊 Technical Metrics

### Build Performance
- **Nix Store Size**: 5.86GB for complete system
- **Module Count**: 15+ modular components
- **Service Count**: 7 major services (GitLab, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, Docker, SSH, etc.)
- **Boot Time**: ~3-5 minutes for full service initialization

### Resource Allocation
```yaml
System Resources:
  Total Memory: 4GB
  CPU Cores: 4
  Disk Space: 6GB base + storage
  
Service Limits:
  GitLab: 8GB memory, 50% CPU
  GitLab Runner: 4GB memory, 25% CPU  
  PostgreSQL: 256MB shared buffers
  Redis: 512MB maxmemory
```

### Network Configuration
```yaml
Port Forwarding:
  8081 → 80   (HTTP/Nginx)
  2224 → 22   (SSH)
  8889 → 8080 (GitLab direct)
