# Current Security Assessment - Critical Issues Identified

## SSH Security Issues (CRITICAL)
- Password authentication enabled (`PasswordAuthentication = true`)
- No SSH key-based authentication configured
- Default user password "agent" is weak and publicly known
- No fail2ban or intrusion prevention configured
- SSH service exposed without hardening

## System Security Issues (HIGH)
- Firewall completely disabled (`networking.firewall.enable = false`)
- Sudo without password for wheel group (`security.sudo.wheelNeedsPassword = false`)
- No secrets management for service credentials
- Services running as unprivileged user but with broad system access

## Network Security Issues (MEDIUM)
- All ports exposed without filtering (3000, 3001, 3002, 22)
- No network segmentation or access controls
- Services bound to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

## Service Security Issues (MEDIUM)  
- Services auto-start without security validation
- No service-to-service authentication
- Configuration files world-readable
- No encryption for inter-service communication

## Data Protection Issues (MEDIUM)
- No disk encryption configured
- User data stored in plaintext
- No backup encryption or secure storage

## Monitoring & Incident Response (LOW)
- No security monitoring configured
- No logging aggregation or analysis
- No incident response procedures
- No security alerting mechanisms

## Immediate Actions Required
1. Disable SSH password authentication
2. Configure SSH key-based authentication
3. Enable and configure firewall
4. Implement fail2ban for intrusion prevention
5. Change default passwords and implement secure secrets management
6. Configure security monitoring and logging
