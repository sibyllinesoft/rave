# Reference

Authoritative specifications, schemas, and command listings live here.

Initial scope:
- CLI reference generated from `rave --help`
- Port matrices for each environment profile
- Secrets catalog + expected SOPS paths
- API schemas (GitLab OAuth, Mattermost bridge, chat-control contracts)

Prefer auto-generated content when possible to avoid drift.
