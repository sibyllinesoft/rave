echo "🔧 RAVE GitLab Redirect Fix Demonstration"
echo "========================================"
echo ""

echo "📋 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "  • GitLab redirects to: http://localhost/users/sign_in (MISSING PORT)"
echo "  • Should redirect to:   http://localhost:8080/users/sign_in (WITH PORT)"
echo ""

echo "🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:"
echo "  • GitLab generates redirect URLs based on the Host header from nginx"
echo "  • Incorrect: proxy_set_header Host \$host;"
echo "  • Correct:   proxy_set_header Host \$host:\$server_port;"
echo ""

echo "⚙️  THE FIX:"
echo "  Updated nginx proxy headers in demo-https-config.nix:"
echo ""
echo "  BEFORE (caused missing port in redirects):"
echo "    proxy_set_header Host \$host;"
echo "    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;"
echo ""
echo "  AFTER (includes port in redirects):"
echo "    proxy_set_header Host \$host:\$server_port;"
echo "    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto \$scheme;"
echo "    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port \$server_port;"
echo ""

echo "📄 Configuration Files Created:"
echo "  ✅ nginx-redirect-fix.conf - Standalone nginx config with proper headers"
echo "  ✅ gitlab-redirect-fix.conf - Complete nginx server block with fix"
echo "  ✅ demo-https-config.nix - Updated NixOS configuration"
echo ""

echo "🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:"
echo "  • Password reset redirects: http://localhost:8080/users/sign_in ✅"
echo "  • Form submissions redirect: http://localhost:8080/... ✅" 
echo "  • All GitLab URLs include port: :8080 ✅"
echo ""

echo "🚀 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:"
echo "  ✅ Root cause identified (nginx Host header)"
echo "  ✅ Fix implemented in configuration files"
echo "  ✅ New VM built with corrected nginx headers"
echo "  🔄 Ready for testing when GitLab backend starts properly"
echo ""

echo "📝 TECHNICAL DETAILS:"
echo "  The Host header is crucial for GitLab's redirect logic."
echo "  GitLab reads the Host header to determine the base URL for redirects."
echo "  Without the port in the Host header, redirects default to port 80."
echo "  This fix ensures all redirects include the correct port number."
